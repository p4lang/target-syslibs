System Abstraction Libraries
==============================================
The <bf-syslib> package contains sources to build system abstraction
functions needed by BF driver stack (e.g. bf-drivers). The interfaces to these
functions is not expected to change but the implementation is expected to be
mapped to the target system's OS services.

Here's a summary of the functions implemented in this package

    bf_sal:
        Timers
        Threading
        Synchronization
        Tracing and Logging
        Heap memory management
        DMA memory management

While the above functions are implementated for LINUX, it is expected they
would be ported to the target system's OS services before the driver stack
is exercised.

Building and installing
=======================
Please refer to P4 Studio installation guide
